    * - Note: Some claim it still possible with a counter and notification etc: https://stackoverflow.com/a/48659562/5389500

    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è üëâ Add the UTType code, it's iOS 14 only üëà
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è get rid of the fatal error
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è add example
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è we will probably make this non static and use singlton to access it in the future?
    * - Parameters:
