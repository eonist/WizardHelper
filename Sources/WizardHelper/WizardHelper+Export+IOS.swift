    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è to add suggested name for file etc, might need to add UIActivityItemSource https://stackoverflow.com/a/40330064/5389500
    * - Important: Must be called from the main thread
    * - Parameters:
    *   - fromURL: The path to the source of the content to save
    *   - fileName: Suggest fileName
    *   - view: The origin-view to launch from
    *   - onComplete: on complete, do additional cleanup etc

    * StorageHelper.promptSaveFile(fromURL: url, fileName: fileInfo.fileName, view: self)
