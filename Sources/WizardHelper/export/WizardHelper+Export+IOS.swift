   * Presents a save dialog for a file located at a given URL using `UIActivityViewController`.
   * This function should be called from the main thread.
   * - Note: The export and import functionality should be moved into separate files.
   * - Note: A typealias for closures and better organization should be added, as well as support for custom file types.
   * - Parameters:
   *   - fromURL: The URL of the file to save.
   *   - view: The view to launch the save dialog from.
   *   - onComplete: A closure to execute when the save dialog is completed or cancelled.
   * - Important: This function requires access to a view controller, so it should be moved to `ViewController.swift` and used with an event to propagate, or a method to get the current view controller from the point of view of the view or current app state should be added.
   * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è To add a suggested name for the file, `UIActivityItemSource` should be added. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/40330064/5389500 for more information.
   * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è add support for success or failure in the onComplete
   * ## Examples:
   * StorageHelper.promptSaveFile(fromURL: url, view: self) {
   *     // Do additional cleanup, etc.
   * }
